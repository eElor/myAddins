<!-- ### Systemic Inflammation And The Metabolic Syndrome -->

<!-- A positive energy balance can profoundly perturb lipid and glucose metabolism. Increased body fat rises lipolysis within adipocytes and promotes FFA mobilization. As a consequence, FFA catabolism in muscle and liver increases, glucose utilization in muscle declines, and hepatic glucoseneogenesis and release is augmented. This leads to hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Further, the low-density (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio is augmented, which amplifies the risk of cardiovascular disease. Small LDL-cholesterol are highly atherogenic since they can more easily permeate arterial walls and undergo oxidation and glycation. -->

<!-- WAT expansion is restricted by the plasticity of the stroma. Limited blood supply can induce adipocyte hypoxia and death, and the activation of a vicious cycle of celular stress signaling culminating in the expression of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. The release of chemokines trigger immune cell infiltration and the formation of crown-structures by activated macrophages. This local pro-inflammatory insult generates not only autocrine/paracrine repercussions on WAT, but has far-reaching endocrine effects. As the WAT continues to expand and its cellular composition is further modified, the symptoms and consequences of a systemic inflammation become apparent through systemic metabolic deterioration, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. -->

## Obesity And The Respiratory System

The ever-growing pandemic of obesity has been positively correlated with the increased pathogenesis of multiple pulmonary diseases[@Mafort2016; @Peters2018]. It is comorbid with asthma[@Sideleva2012], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[@Zhi2016], obstructive sleep apnea, hypoventilation syndrome[@Phtl2017], pulmonary hypertension[@Friedman2012], COPD[@Behrens2014] and lung fibrosis[@]. It complicates the pathogenesis of COPD[@Franssen2008] and is associated with primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation[@Lederer2011], higher mortality rates from influenza[@Smith2007a; @Jain2011], and idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF)[@Gries2015]. 

<!-- Be aware of the "obesity survival paradox"! -->

Obesity has shown to impair cross-talk mechanisms between adipose tissue and the brain[@Bartness2007], liver[@Moschen2012], muscle[@Trayhurn2011] and pancreas[@Kadre2013]. Several hypotheses for the explanation of such pathological cross-talk mechanisms have been proposed[@Lee2009]. These include interactions through free fatty acids, as well as through endocrine, immune and neural factors. The presence of ectopically stored fat with toxic effects, and the altered entdothelial functions have been suggested as well[@Lee2009]. 

Lung homeostasis can be dramatically altered by obesity through a combination of mass loading, endocrine and metabolic factors. A cross-talk between the adipose tissue and the lung based on the mutual influence through inflammatory factors has been proposed[@Mancuso2010]. While pro-inflammatory adipokines in the circulation, e. g. leptin, have shown to modulate lung immune responses[@Hsu2007], lung-derived pro-inflammatory factors secreted into the circulation may as well amplify inflammation in the adipose tissue[@Sun2009].

In terms of mass loading, fat accumulation in the abdomen and thorax can directly reshape biomechanical properties of the respiratory system[@Watson2010]. This mechanical load often leads to elevated pleural pressure as well as decreased lung volumes[@Salome2010; @Brazzale2015]. Consequently, functional residual capacity, compliance, expiratory reserve volume, and total lung capacity tend to decrease with obesity, leading to increased respiratory work load and impairment of the respiratory muscles[@Unterborn2001; @Salome2010; @Brazzale2015].

Factors secreted by hypertrophic adipose tissue found in the circulation of obese individuals can present pleiotropic effects and contribute to lung disease. An endocrine consequence of obesity known to influence the respiratory system is the reduced circulating concentration of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin. This factor can inhibit eosinophilia and allergic airway inﬂammation[@Medoff2009]. Adiponectin deficiency might be the link between obesity, asthma[@Sideleva2012], COPD[@Krommidas2010], vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension[@Medoff2009] as well as ARDS[@Zhi2016]. Further, raised levels of TNF have shown to promote both emphysema and pulmonary ﬁbrosis and increase general lung inflammation[@Lundblad2005]. TNF can also reinforce airway neutrophilic inﬂammation, as showed in a model of ozone-induced lung inflammation[@Williams2015].



<!-- In summary, complex and multifactorial implications brought about by obesity can directly or indirectly contribute to the development of lung diseases.  -->

<!-- Lastly, metabolic deregulation during obesity leads to augmented concentrations of triacylglycerol, free fatty acids, insulin and glucose in blood. These factors by themselves can lead to airway reactivity[@Peters2018], oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction. -->

<!-- weiteres auf "C:\Users\eev\Documents\HMGU\THESIS\literature\obesity and lung\New folder\2017 Beyond BMI obesity and lung diesease.pdf" -->

<!-- systemic inflammatory status plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Obesity compromises general lung mechanics by restricting lung volume, reducing chest wall compliance, and attenuating respiratory muscle efficiency. A plausible crosstalk between adipose and lung tissues may also exist: adipocyte hypertrophy caused by a positive energy balance leads to hypoxia in adipose tissue, apoptosis of adipocytes, and recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages to this endocrine organ. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1, IL-6,TNF-α), and pro-inflammatory adipocytokines (Leptin, Resistin, Visfatin), the reduction of the anti-inflammatory adipocytokine adiponectin, as well as the increased numbers of peripheral white blood cells, and triacylglycerol and free fatty acids in the blood leads to systemic inflammation. This may enhance local pulmonary inflammation through augmented leukocyte recruitment, enhanced cytokine production, increased vascular permeability, and airway obstruction, as well as through a modification of the polarization status of AMs. Challenges like lung injury and infections lead to local inflammation of the lung and exacerbate the release of inflammatory mediators by adipose tissue creating a vicious circle of inflammation. -->

### DOHaD: Parental Obesity And The Offspring Lung

<!-- General evidence of the effect of parental obesity -->
A large body of epidemiological and clinical studies as well as animal experiments have consistently provided substantial evidence of the transgenerational effects of famine on offspring's metabolic, cognitive, developmental and endocrine health[@Hoffman2017a]. In face of today's obesity pandemic, DOHaD research has shifted its attention to study long term consequences of parental obesity on offspring. Initial epidemiological and animal studies have shown that offspring born to obese mothers present similar metabolic and developmental outcomes as those born to famine-exposed mothers -- especially in terms of adverse metabolic outcomes like increased risk for diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome in later life[@Oken2003; @Heerwagen2010]. The specific effect of parental obesity as well as their plausible molecular causes have been since studied in more detail.

Parental nutrition has become a major predictor of adverse long-term detriment in offspring, including possible immune-related outcomes[@Godfrey2017]. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with higher risk of both maternal and foetal complications[@Leddy2008; @Mamun2011]. Foetal neural tube defects, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia[@Stothard2009], increased overall foetal mortality[@Aune2014], preeclampsia[@Jaramillo2018], risks of cerebral palsy, attention-deficit disorder, cognitive delay, and autism  are some known examples[@Dietl2005; @Harmon2018].

<!-- importance of the placenta -->
As the primary metabolic, respiratory, excretory and endocrine organ during pregnancy, the placenta plays an essential role in shaping the intrauterine environment for developmental programming[@Perri2016]. For this reason, research on transgenerational effects of obesity has focused on the role of maternal obesity on DOHaD. Metabolic and inflammatory changes brought about by maternal obesity have been proposed to extend to the placenta. This would suggest an exposure of the foetus to an inflammatory environment and elevated levels of free fatty acids during development[@Heerwagen; @Lewis2017]. The presence of increased pro-inflammatory molecules (CRP and TNF) in the amniotic fluid of overweight mothers[@Bugatto2010] as well as of a systemic inflammation in offspring -- apparent by an increased abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the foetal circulation (IL6, IL17A, and IFNg)[@Kim2014] -- support this hypothesis. Maternal obesity has shown to directly shape the morphology and gene expression in placental tissue[@Song2017]. Obese pregnant mouse dams present an altered thickness of placental tissue layers as well as impaired placental cell proliferation and gene expression[@Kim2014]. Obesity also leads to increased placental macrophage activation and elevated cytokine (Tnf, Il1b, Il6, Nlrp3, and Il10) expression[@Segovia2014; @Kim2014; @Mayor2015; @Wallace2019]. 

<!-- effect of maternal obesity on specific offspring's organ development -->
Specific effects of maternal obesity on offspring's organ development have been extensively studied. Especially effects on metabolic organs like the liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue, but also on other organs like the brain and gut have been widely described. The presence of inflammation as well as increased oxidative stress on these organs is common for foetuses from obese mothers[@Bilbo2010; @Yan2011; @Kim2014; @Fink2014]. Maternal obesity has shown to induce steatosis as well as liver inflammation, fibrosis and liver mitochondrial dysfunction[@Bruce2009; @Mouralidarane2013; @Thompson2019]. Maternal HFD can induce insulin resistance and deterioration of pancreatic $\beta$-cell function[@Yokomizo2014], alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial function[@Pileggi2016] and impair neurological development[@Niculescu2009; @Silva2014] as well as congnitive funcions[@Cordner2019] in offspring.

<!-- maternal obesity and the offspring lung -->
The lung is not absent of parental obesity-induced detriments. Offspring of obese women are at overall greater risk for respiratory complications at birth[@Haberg2009]. Babies born to obese women display increased risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)[@McIntyre2012]. RDS is a condition often present in premature children[@Boyle1978]. It is characterized by reduced leves of surfactant in the lungs, collapsed air spaces, vascular congestion and hyaline membranes -- composed of fibrin, cellular debris, erythrocytes, neutrophils and macrophages -- that inhibit gas exchange and lead to hypoxia[@Ablow1981]. Foetal risk of developing RDS has been attributed to alterations in maternal metabolism due to overnutrition[@Lock2017]. Deficiency of surfactant -- vital for the reduction of surface tension at the tissue-air interface and prevention of alveolar collapse and support of pulmonary immunity[@Haberg2009] -- has been related to increased insulin concentrations in plasma of mothers with metabolic disorders. This is especially the case for diabetic mothers[@Snyder1988; @Rayani1999]. 

Studies on maternal overnutrition have also shown that obesity/overnutrition can induce a dysregulation (overactivity) of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)[@Schutten2017]. The presence of angiotensin 1 and 2 receptors on ATII cells as well as lung fibroblast has already been demonstrated[@Schutten2017]. For this reason, scientists have speculated on the possible role of RAS in the alteration the surfactant system, interference with foetal lung development and breathing complications as well as pulmonary fibrosis of neonates[@Lock2013]. 

Maternal obesity and diabetes might contribute to a maladaptation of the lung's circulation at birth and lead to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn[@Storme2013]. A plausible explanation for this could lie in the deficiency of L-arginine -- an amino acid required for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis[@Vesadtka1994]. NO modulates foetal pulmonary vascular tone[@Klinger2017]. Studies have highlighted that maternal HFD as well as hyperglycemia can lead to impaired pulmonary L-arginine/NO metabolism in offspring[@Grasemann2017].

The L-arginine/NO metabolism is not only importart for vascular contractility, structural integrity of the blood vessels and angiogenesis[@Altaany2013], but also critical for the innate immune function[@Rath2014]. Arginine-catabolizing enzymes -- specifically nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and arginases -- tightly control the immune response under physiological and pathological conditions. Critical immune, homeostatic and regenerative behaviours of myeloid cells -- importantly of macrophages in the lung[@Rath2014] -- are controled by the arginine metabolism[@Rodriguez2017]. Therefore, alterations in this metabolic pathway could alter and possibly compromise lung immunity, including macrophage's role in development and regeneration. 

Interestingly, in a model of maternal obesity, pre- and perinatal HFD has been implicated in increased total cell numbers, neutrophil counts and concentration of IL6 in lavage of mouse offspring at 10 weeks of age[@MacDonald2017]. Similar results were observed in a model of neonatal overfeeding, were adult mice exibited increased neutrophil, lymphocyte and macrophage numbers as well as increased concentrations of TNF in BALF at P150[@Ye2012]. Maternal HFD has been associated in the activation of the NF$\kappa$B-pathway in the mouse pup lung tissue at P21[@Heyob2019]. Additionally, rodent models of maternal hypercaloric feeding have shown a detrimental effect of maternal diet on the severity of viral lung infections[@Griffiths2016].

Griffiths et al. could demonstrate in a rat model that maternal hypercaloric diet during pregnancy alone can induce transient systemic and lung inflammation in offspring[@].

The question of the effect of foetal exposure to inflammation during pregnancy on the immune system of the lung has prevailed. Scientist have often asked if inflammation could lead to priming of the innate immune system[@Kramer2009] and how this would see -- on one hand with the possibility of being paralysed (tolerance/exhaustion), on the other with an enhanced pro-inflammatory reaction (inflammatory hyperactivity).

<!-- Obesity > higher plasma concentration of free fatty acids > increase in nutrient transport over the placenta (FFA?)[@] > (over?)activation of PPARg[@] > possible dysregulation in AM development[@]; activation of pulmonary lipofibroblasts[@] and secretion of leptin[@] > activation of ATII cell for surfactant production[@](? protective?). PPARg agonists have shown to have a positive (protective) effect allergic airway inflammation and asthma[10.1165/ajrcmb.24.6.f210; 10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.5248]. -->

It has been long known, that maternal obesity is associated with increased susceptibility to wheezing in early childhood[@Guerra2013; @Leermakers2013] and asthma later in life[@Forno2014]. Even though the exact mechanisms have not been discovered, yet[@Rusconi2017], rodent models corroborate the link between maternal overnutrition and offspring's innate airway hyperresponsiveness[@Griffiths2016; @MacDonald2017]. Maternal HFD lead in mouse models of diet induced obesity to increased total resistance of the respiratory system[@MacDonald2017]. Neonatal overfeeding -- a possible side effect of maternal obesity -- has shown to lead to lung fibrosis at P150 in mice[@Ye2012].
<!-- what is known? -> lung volumes, hyperresponsiveness, fibrosis/airway remodelling, ... -->

In 2009 it has been hypothesized that foetal inflammatory exposures may modulate postnatal lung development and function[@Kramer2009]. The presence of a systemic low-grade inflammation, the increased concentration of free fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and adipokines like leptin as well as the raise in oxidative stress in dams exposed to HFD might affect offspring's lung development and function. In 2013, two authors[@McEvoy2013; @Mayor2013] independently presented in two conferences the first evidence that murine offspring born to HFD dams can experience changes in lung structure and function. 

increased expression of inflammatory markers in the lung[@] 

<!-- Effect of paternal diet -->
Thanks to advancements in epigenetic studies, the importance of paternal heritability has also been recognised[@]. Increasing evidence advocates epigenetic mechanisms (like histone modifications and DNA methylation) in the control of transgenerational effects caused by parental obesity as well as their transmission to later generations[@Agarwal2018].

Metabolic inflammation as programming mechanism[@Segovia2014].

The foetal lung expresses leptin and leptin receptor[@Bergen2002]. Leptin has shown to be involved in normal physiologic function of the lung, promoting neonatal lung growth and development as well as surfactant protein A production[@Chen2013]. Altered maternal leptin signaling might directly affect neonatal lung development.

The glucocorticoid cortisol provides an essential maturational, environmental, and programming signal for normal intrauterine development. One of the major hypotheses proposed for DOHaD is that foetal overexposure to this hormone may lead to a disruption of a healthy foetal development[@Reynolds2013]. Animal experiments leading to increased foetal glucocorticoid exposure have shown reduced offspring growth, associated with increased cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance, and mental health and cognitive problems, later in life[@Cottrell2009]. <!-- obesity can lead to increased circulating cortisol concentrations -->


Obesity during pregnancy leads to a reduced fetal lung maturation and increased collagen deposition in the lung

Maternal HFD feeding during pregnancy and lactation lead to aggravated lung inflammatory response and
lung remodeling in offspring[@Song2014] (10.1016/j.resp.2014.12.003)

Expression of inflammatory markers in the placenta,
decreased fetal viability in the utero,
reduced fetal lung maturation,
diminished expression of surfactant.
(Mayor et al., 2015 American Journal of Physiology,
DOI: 10.1152/ajplung.00105.2015 )

Mechanistically, delayed pulmonary alveolarization and increased mortality in offspring from dams fed on a HFD may be related to
a defective response to ROS,
disrupted lipid utilization and lipid-associated gene expression, and/or
an abnormal response to leptin.
(Williams et al., 2017. Research in Veterinary Science. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.05.020)

Maternal HFD feeding during pregnancy and lactation is a critical determinant of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in offspring and also increases risk for bronchiolitis.
Pro-inflammatory and metabolical effects derived from maternal nutrition are sustained after birth, even until adulthood, although they decrease with age.
(Griffiths et al., 2016. Pediatric research. doi:10.1038/pr.2015.226)

At 3 months of age, mice exposed to maternal HFD had fewer and larger alveoli than mice exposed to maternal CD

<!-- Excess energy intake can lead to hyperglycemia (excess in blood glucose) and hyperlipidemia (increased free fatty acids and other lipids in the circulation). Circulating high-energetic molecules (glucose and lipis) can exert toxic and damaging effects on the individual's metabolism and lead to low-grade systemic inflammation. -->

<!-- A primary source of pro-inflammatory cytokines during obesity are resident and recruited immune cells in adipose tissue as well as adipocytes themselves. However, the pancreas[@Nunemaker2014] and liver have been proposed to contribute to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adipokines as well, prosibly contributing to the grade of systemic inflammation. -->

<!-- Pro-inflammatory peptides released into the circulation can be measured in plasma and serum of obese individuals and play important role as contributing factors in the development and pathogenesis of T2D and other metabolic diseases. -->

<!-- Obesity-induced systemic low-grade inflammation can potentially cause damaging effects in distal tissues. For instance, exposure to circulating levels of IL6 has been shown to trigger dysfunction and apoptosis in pancreatic islets of Langerhans from diabetes-prone mice (O'Neill, et al. 2013 PubMed: 23836031). Further, authors from a study published in 2014 examined 32 different cytokines in serum of leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. They confirmed great increases only in serum CXCL1 and CXCL5 levels as animals became obese and hyperglycemic. Further, these authors could demonstrate a direct impact on the function of insulin-producing prancreas islets through exposure to CXCL1 and CXCL5 at circulating levels *in vitro*[@Nunemaker2014]. -->

<!-- Based on the theory of early origins of disease, we could see this developmental path as a possible window of vulnerability. -->

<!-- As many “modern” diseases, obesity has become epidemic. Mainly the often accompanying metabolic syndrome carriages great risk for non-communicable diseases (chronic) and has a profound effect on the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, contributing to asthma, lung fibrosis, COPD, and increases the mortality from viral and bacterial infections. -->

<!-- A hallmark of the metabolic syndrome is the presence of a systemic low grade inflammation which originates if a given individual maintains a high energy intake for a long period of time. -->

<!-- This leads to the hypertrophy of adipocytes, cells that store this energy in form of fat and eventually undergo pyroptosis, leaving the fat globule and danger associated molecular patterns exposed which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells. If the high energy intake does not decrease, the expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines eventually reach systemic concentrations. -->
